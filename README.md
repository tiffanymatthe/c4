# Connect 4 AI
Training for a Connect 4 AI based on AlphaGo Zero's algorithm and code from https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general.
Includes multiprocessing which can be enabled in the Config.py file.
- config.processes is generally equal to the number of cores of the machine.

Other notes:
- use `tqdm.write()` when printing at the same time a tqdm progress bar is running.
